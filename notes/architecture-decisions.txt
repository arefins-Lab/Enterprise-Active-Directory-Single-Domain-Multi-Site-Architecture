ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS – Enterprise AD Multi‑Site Architecture
Domain: mylab.test
===============================================================

[1] Domain Name
    - Chosen: mylab.test
    - Reason: Non-routable, lab-safe, avoids .local issues

[2] Multi-Site Design
    - Building A = SiteA
    - Building B = SiteB
    - Reason: Clear separation for replication topology

[3] Subnet Allocation
    - 192.168.1.0/24 → SiteA (Servers + Clients)
    - 192.168.2.0/24 → SiteA (DHCP Failover + Clients)
    - 192.168.3.0/24 → SiteB (ADC + Clients)
    - Reason: Clean segmentation, easy routing, scalable

[4] DNS Architecture
    - Primary DNS on DC-SRV01
    - Secondary DNS on ADC-SRV01
    - Reason: Redundancy + replication consistency

[5] DHCP Architecture
    - DHCP-SRV01 = Primary
    - DHCP-SRV02 = Failover Partner
    - Reason: High availability + load balance

[6] Hyper-V Virtualisation
    - All servers virtualised
    - Reason: Cost-free, flexible, snapshot-friendly

[7] No Templates Used
    - Entire architecture designed manually
    - Diagram created from scratch
    - Reason: Ensures originality and deep understanding
