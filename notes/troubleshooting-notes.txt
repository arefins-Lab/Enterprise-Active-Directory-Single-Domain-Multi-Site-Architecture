TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES – Enterprise AD Multi‑Site Architecture
Domain: mylab.test
===============================================================

[1] Domain Join Issues
    - Check DNS server IP on client (must point to DC)
    - Flush DNS: ipconfig /flushdns
    - Reset secure channel: Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Repair

[2] DNS Problems
    - Ensure DC-SRV01 and ADC-SRV01 both have DNS role
    - Restart DNS service if zone not replicating
    - Check zone replication scope: Forest

[3] Replication Errors
    - Run: repadmin /replsummary
    - Check AD Sites & Services subnet mapping
    - Ensure both DCs can resolve each other by FQDN

[4] DHCP Issues
    - Verify scopes are active
    - Ensure failover relationship is healthy

        192.168.3.1
    - Check firewall rules if ping fails

[6] GPO Not Applying
    - Run: gpupdate /force
    - Check SYSVOL replication
    - Validate client time sync with domain

[7] ADC Promotion Fails
    - Ensure server is domain-joined
    - DNS must point to DC-SRV01
